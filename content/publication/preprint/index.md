abstract: This paper develops a new monetary shock series that is free of the information channel by combining computational text analysis methods with a narrative approach. Dictionary methods as well as a correlated topic model are used to quantify the informational content published by the Federal Open Market Committee. This exercise empirically approximates the signal extraction problem of private agents and hence, the text-based variables can be used to free changes in the federal funds rate from the information channel. At the same time, controlling for the textual information in central bank minutes is enough to obtain unpredictable shocks. The new shock series cannot be predicted by Greenbook forecasts or macroeconomic factors obtained through principal component analysis. It is then shown that these two features, contrary to more conventional monetary policy shock measures, make the new series robust to changes in the estimation period. Notably, contractionary shocks are no longer expansionary for the post 1983 period.
